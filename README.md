## Workflow
1. Build from scratch a pseudocode to outline the idea.
2. Gather information from different resources to understand the tools that apply to this project's needs.
3. Import the libraries prior the coding process. 
4. Start with a try & error stage. 
5. Debug the code before attempting to simplify it.
6. Make a legible layout (documentation included) by merging all the functions into a master function. 
7. Run a second try & error stage.
8. Start extracting data.
9. Identify how the data must be processed and cleaned to be reliable for further analysis in the future.
10. Implement a function for data cleaning.
11. Execute a Final Diagnosis. 
10. Start exploring the Data.
