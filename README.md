## Project Description
The purpose behind this project is to be able to extract all data regarding Mexico's international operations (imports & exports), using UN COMTRADE DATABASE's Public API.

After exploring the data through different queries in Postman, the following insights were gathered:

Mexico started reporting its operations until 1990, so prior to this year, all data is unavailable.

From 1990 to 2009, all data reported by Mexico was recorded by Year, so we are not going to be able to explore how trade perfomed month by month in this time period.

Keep in mind the following ...

Public Users have only access to 1000 queries per hour, 1 query per second. *Queries should be specific and simple.
So, the challenge was to create a program that automatically extracts the data considering all the restrictions that we Public Users have.

## Workflow
1. Build from scratch a pseudocode to outline the idea.
2. Gather information from different resources to understand the tools that apply to this project's needs.
3. Import the libraries prior the coding process. 
4. Start with a try & error stage. 
5. Debug the code before attempting to simplify it.
6. Make a legible layout (documentation included) by merging all the functions into a master function. 
7. Run a second try & error stage.
8. Start extracting data.
9. Identify how the data must be processed and cleaned to be reliable for further analysis in the future.
10. Implement a function for data cleaning.
11. Execute a Final Diagnosis. 
10. Start exploring the Data.
